First you need to run the npm install command into the two folders be(backend) and fe(frontend) to install the necessary things for the project.
cd be -> npm install
cd fe -> npm install
Your can use npm start to run both front-end and back-end. Make sure you have MongoDB in your machine, because it will be the data storage
